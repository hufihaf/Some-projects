Tuning: String tuning, from lowest to highest (i.e. "EADG").
        May also include up to 6 strings (i.e. "EADGBE2").
          PLEASE NOTE: If your tuning icludes a duplicate note, as with the previous example,
                       use a single digit number after the higher note to differentiate from the first (see previous example).
        If your tuning includes a flat or a sharp, type 'b' or '#' after your note (i.e. "EbADG").
          PLEASE NOTE: In the case of a duplicate note AND a flat/sharp, type the 'b'/'#' AND THEN the single digit number (i.e. "EbABDGEb2").
